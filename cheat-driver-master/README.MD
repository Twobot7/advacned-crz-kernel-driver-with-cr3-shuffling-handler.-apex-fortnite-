- Timer-based updates

## Building the Driver

1. Requirements:
   - Visual Studio 2019+
   - Windows Driver Kit (WDK)
   - Windows SDK
   - Test signing certificate

2. Build Steps:
   ```bash
   # Open VS Developer Command Prompt
   msbuild driver.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
   ```

3. Testing:
   - Use a VM
   - Enable test signing
   - Use proper driver loading tools

## Learning Resources

To understand this code:
1. Study Windows kernel development
2. Learn x64 assembly
3. Understand paging/CR3
4. Study anti-debugging techniques
5. Learn cryptographic principles

## Security Notes

This driver implements:
- Memory integrity checking
- Anti-debugging measures
- Polymorphic mutations
- Decoy generation

However, it's been modified to prevent misuse:
- Some security checks removed
- Critical functions incomplete
- Validation logic altered
- Error handling simplified

## Intended Use

1. **Educational:**
   - Study kernel programming
   - Learn anti-analysis techniques
   - Understand memory management
   - Research security concepts

2. **Research:**
   - Driver development
   - Security testing
   - Memory analysis
   - Anti-debugging research

## DO NOT USE FOR:
- Malicious purposes
- Production systems
- Cheating/hacking
- Bypassing security

Remember: Kernel drivers require deep technical knowledge and careful testing. This code is for learning purposes only.
